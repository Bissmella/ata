"""Optional Pipecat bridge — reach the long tail of STT/TTS providers.

Pipecat (https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) maintains service plugins for
dozens of STT/TTS providers (Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Azure, ...). Rather
than re-wrapping each one, ATA exposes a single bridge that adapts a Pipecat
service to ATA's ``STTClient`` / ``TTSClient`` interface, so the whole ecosystem
is reachable and maintained upstream.

This is an OPTIONAL extra — Pipecat is not a core dependency. Install with::

    pip install "ata[pipecat]"

NOTE (scaffold): Pipecat services are streaming / frame-based, whereas the thin
channel calls them in batch. The batch<->frame glue is intentionally left as a
focused follow-up; construction lazily imports Pipecat and fails with an
actionable message if the extra is missing. See ``docs/voice-plan.md``.
